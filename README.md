# gulp-configurator

Looking for the same gulp snippets over and over again? Copying the gulpfile from project to project?
This app provides help for both those scenarios:

## Snippets
You'll find various snippets for gulp. Ranging from the base outline to template, style and javascript processing or more sophisticated and custom tasks as newsletter processing or pattern library generation.
